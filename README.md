# Hubspot Landing Page

## Section 2 

In this section,I provided it in 2 parts - navbar and flexbox. 
I am buiding the navbar by using boostraps. In addition, I also add dropdown menu, but I cannot make the mega menu in my dropdown. I have some ideas for the mega menu. It is like flexbox. I am going to one big container under my dropdown. Inside the big container, it will has 3 braches (3 smaller boxes). my question is how can I make a display for it?

In the second part, I am using flexbox. This kinda like our spotify landing home page.
